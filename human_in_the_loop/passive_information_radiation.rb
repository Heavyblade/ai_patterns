# Passive Information Radiation
#
# This pattern describes an AI system where the AI provides information-feedback to the user
# without the user having to ask for it. This pattern is useful when the AI has information
# that the user may not know they need.
#
# Examples:
# * Desktop assistant that provides reminders and notifications.
# * Monitoring system that alerts the user to potential issues.
# * AI that monitors financial transactions assesing risk and sending alerts.
