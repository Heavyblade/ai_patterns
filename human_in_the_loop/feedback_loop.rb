# Feedback Loop
#
# The feedback loop pattern is best described as a conversation between the LLM and the user.
# It could take the form of chat, a survey, or a conversation between a writer and an editor.
# In all its forms, the feedback loop is a way to improve the model output by providing new
# feedback and adjustments.
#
# Areas where this pattern can be used:
# * Content creation
# * Summarization
# * Question answering conversations, like chatbots or teaching assistants.
