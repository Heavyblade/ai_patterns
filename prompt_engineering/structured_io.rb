# Structured I/O
#
# Structured I/O involves applying a structure in XML, JSON, or YAML to the input/output
# to be more specific about the data being passed around.
#
# From the input point of view, it improves accuracy.
# From the output point of view, it makes the output easier to parse.
#
# Notes:
# * It could be more expensive.
# * It could reduce the LLM's flexibility/creativity.
# * Compatibility could be an issue, as not all LLMs support structured I/O.
